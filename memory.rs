//memory invariants
// Memory that is being allocated will never be allocated to a segment that is currently
// mapped
// Allocating and deallocating specific memory segments will not affect any other segments
// in memory
// The amount of words stored in a segment will never change from its initial length (unless
// unmapped then mapped with a different length)
// Each word will always be a u32.
// Attempting to map to already mapped segments will always fail
// Attempting to unmap already unmapped segments will always fail
// Attempting to access an unmapped segment that was previously mapped will act like a
// floating pointer
// Attempting to access a word out of the bounds of a segmentâ€™s length will always fail
